TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, OUR COMPANY AND ITS OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, DIRECTORS, SHAREHOLDERS, PARENTS, SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, AGENTS, AND LICENSORS ("**_AFFILIATES_**") DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, CONDITIONS, AND REPRESENTATIONS OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT AND THOSE ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE.  \\n\\nIN PARTICULAR, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, OUR COMPANY AND ITS AFFILIATES MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES ABOUT THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF CONTENT AVAILABLE ON OR THROUGH THE SITE OR SERVICES, OR THE CONTENT OF ANY WEBSITES OR ONLINE SERVICES LINKED TO OR INTEGRATED WITH THE SITE OR SERVICES.  OUR COMPANY AND ITS AFFILIATES WILL HAVE NO LIABILITY FOR ANY:  (a) ERRORS, MISTAKES, OR INACCURACIES OF CONTENT; (b) PERSONAL INJURY OR PROPERTY DAMAGE RESULTING FROM YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF THE SITE OR SERVICES; (c) ANY UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OR USE OF OUR SERVERS OR OF ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION OR USER DATA; (d) ANY INTERRUPTION OF TRANSMISSION TO OR FROM THE SITE OR SERVICES; (e) ANY BUGS, VIRUSES, TROJAN HORSES, OR THE LIKE WHICH MAY BE TRANSMITTED ON OR THROUGH THE SITE OR SERVICES BY ANY THIRD PARTY; OR (f) ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE OF ANY KIND INCURRED AS A RESULT OF THE USE OF ANY CONTENT POSTED OR SHARED THROUGH THE SITE OR SERVICES. \\n\\nYOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY MATERIAL OR INFORMATION DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE OF THE SITE OR SERVICES IS DONE AT YOUR OWN RISK AND THAT YOU WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE ARISING FROM DOING SO.

If we assume the defense of such a matter, you will reasonably cooperate with us in such defense.\\n\\n15. **Arbitration Agreement & Waiver of Certain Rights**\\n\\nExcept as set forth below, you and we agree that we will resolve any disputes between us (including any disputes between you and a third-party agent of ours) through binding and final arbitration instead of through court proceedings.  You and we hereby waive any right to a jury trial of any Claim (defined below).  All controversies, claims, counterclaims, or other disputes arising between you and us or you and a third-party agent of ours (each a "**_Claim_**") shall be submitted for binding arbitration in accordance with the Rules of the American Arbitration Association ("**_AAA Rules_**").  The arbitration will be heard and determined by a single arbitrator.  The arbitrator\'s decision in any such arbitration will be final and binding upon the parties and may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction.  You and we agree that the arbitration proceedings will be kept confidential and that the existence of the proceeding and any element of it (including, without limitation, any pleadings, briefs or other documents submitted or exchanged and any testimony or other oral submissions and awards) will not be disclosed beyond the arbitration proceedings, except as may lawfully be required in judicial proceedings relating to the arbitration, by applicable disclosure rules and regulations of securities regulatory authorities or other governmental agencies, or as specifically permitted by state law.  The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this agreement.  However, the Arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have the exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of this Agreement including, but not limited to, a claim that all or any part of this Agreement is void or voidable.\\n\\nIf you demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, we will pay as much of the administrative costs and arbitrator\'s fees required for the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the cost of the arbitration from being prohibitive.  In the final award, the arbitrator may apportion the costs of arbitration and the compensation of the arbitrator among the parties in such amounts as the arbitrator deems appropriate. \\n\\nThis arbitration agreement does not preclude either party from seeking action by federal, state, or local government agencies.  You and we also have the right to bring qualifying claims in small claims court.  In addition, you and we retain the right to apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for provisional relief, including pre-arbitral attachments or preliminary injunctions, and any such request shall not be deemed incompatible with these Terms, nor a waiver of the right to have disputes submitted to arbitration as provided in these Terms.\\n\\nNeither you nor we may act as a class representative or private attorney general, nor participate as a member of a class of claimants, with respect to any Claim.  Claims may not be arbitrated on a class or representative basis.  The arbitrator can decide only your and/or our individual Claims.  The arbitrator may not consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated.  The arbitrator may award in the arbitration the same damages or other relief available under applicable law, including injunctive and declaratory relief, as if the action were brought in court on an individual basis.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing or herein, the arbitrator may not issue a "public injunction" and any such "public injunction" may be awarded only by a federal or state court.  If either party seeks a "public injunction," all other claims and prayers for relief must be adjudicated in arbitration first and any prayer or claim for a "public injunction" in federal or state court stayed until the arbitration is completed, after which the federal or state court can adjudicate the party's claim or prayer for "public injunctive relief."  In doing so, the federal or state court is bound under principles of claim or issue preclusion by the decision of the arbitrator.\\n\\nIf any provision of this Section is found to be invalid or unenforceable, then that specific provision shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed, but the remainder of this Section shall continue in full force and effect.  No waiver of any provision of this Section of the Terms will be effective or enforceable unless recorded in a writing signed by the party waiving such a right or requirement.  Such a waiver shall not waive or affect any other portion of this Terms.  This Section of the Terms will survive the termination of your relationship with us.\\n\\nTHIS SECTION LIMITS CERTAIN RIGHTS, INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO MAINTAIN A COURT ACTION, THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL, THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY FORM OF CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE CLAIM, THE RIGHT TO ENGAGE IN DISCOVERY EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN AAA RULES, AND THE RIGHT TO CERTAIN REMEDIES AND FORMS OF RELIEF.  OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU OR WE WOULD HAVE IN COURT ALSO MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE IN ARBITRATION.\\n\\n16. **Other Provisions**\\n\\nUnder no circumstances will we be held liable for any delay or failure in performance due in whole or in part to any acts of nature or other causes beyond our reasonable control.\\n\\nThese Terms will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas, without giving effect to any conflict of laws rules or provisions.  \\n\\nYou agree that any action of whatever nature arising from or relating to these Terms, the Site, or Services will be filed only in the state or federal courts located in Travis County, Texas.  You consent and submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of any such action.  \\n\\nIf any provision of these Terms is found to be unlawful or unenforceable, then that provision will be deemed severable from these Terms and will not affect the enforceability of any other provisions.  \\n\\nThe failure by us to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not prevent us from enforcing such right or provision in the future.\\n\\nWe may assign our rights and obligations under these Terms, including in connection with a merger, acquisition, sale of assets or equity, or by operation of law.\\n\\n17. **Changes to these Terms**\\n\\nFrom time to time, we may change these Terms.  If we change these Terms, we will give you notice by posting the revised Terms on the Site.  Those changes will go into effect on the Revision Date shown in the revised Terms.  By continuing to use the Site or Services, you are agreeing to the revised Terms.  \\n\\n**PLEASE PRINT A COPY OF THESE TERMS FOR YOU RECORDS AND PLEASE CHECK THE SITE FREQUENTLY FOR ANY CHANGES TO THESE TERMS.**\\n`,
