**Once upon a time, anxiety helped us survive. Like fire from gods, it was the spark that kept us on our toes when danger came around the corner.**

**“[Anxiety] comes from our forebears in prehistoric times who needed to get out of trouble in a hurry,” explains Professor of Counseling at Bradley University [Nancy Sherman](https://onlinedegrees.bradley.edu/faculty/nancy-sherman/), PhD. “Hence, the “fight or flight” response occurs when danger is sensed. Changes in the body prepare the person to flee from the danger or fight the foe.”**

**Some situational dangers, like saber-toothed tigers, may be gone now but our fear response is still there. It’s in the elevator before a job interview, on the train during rush hour, or at the dinner table with your new partner’s parents.**

**For close to 20 percent of us, [anxiety is a chronic issue](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/any-anxiety-disorder.shtml). And when left unmanaged, it can derail how we enjoy life. Which is why it’s so important to learn how to deal with the symptoms.**

**Whether you need to soothe your anxiety right now, before tonight, or in the long-term, we got you. Because there are all kinds of anxiety and what works for you one minute may be different from what works down the line.**

**How to ease your anxiety right now**

**Use the following techniques if your anxiety is peaking as we speak.**

### **First, breathe**

**Deep breathing is like the little black dress of coping techniques: it’s helpful in virtually all difficult situations. That’s because inhaling and exhaling deeply is a way to [rein in our fight or flight response](https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/relaxation-techniques-breath-control-helps-quell-errant-stress-response).**

**“Diaphragmatic breathing is the basis for most relaxation techniques and meditation,” says Sherman. “It lowers blood pressure, slows the heart rate, and helps people relax, among other benefits.”**

#### **How to do it**

**There are [many breathing techniques](https://greatist.com/happiness/breathing-exercises-relax) that help with anxiety but one of our favorites is a simple sequence called box breathing. To do it, follow these steps:**

1. **Inhale through your nose and into your belly for a count of 4.**
2. **Hold your breath for a count of 4.**
3. **Exhale through your mouth for a count of 4, pushing all the air out of your belly.**
4. **Hold your breath for a count of 4.**
5. **Repeat.**

### **Imagine a place you feel calm**

**[Imagery visualization](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/stress-management/in-depth/relaxation-technique/art-20045368) is a meditation technique where you focus on a calming scene or memory to guide your mind away from what’s causing your anxiety. The idea is that once your mind calms, your body will follow.**

#### **How to do it**

1. **Find a quiet, comfy place and take a seat.**
2. **Close your eyes.**
3. **Now file through all your wonderful memories and pick a scene or time you felt calm and content.**
4. **You want to imagine as much of the sensory experience of that special place as you can. What does it smell like? Was it sunny that day and if so, what does the sun feel like on your skin? What do you hear?**

**It’s normal for this to feel challenging at first. As with any meditation, it’s a practice. The more you do it, the easier it will be to train your brain to a peaceful place.**

### **Get started with a meditation app**

**[Meditation apps](https://greatist.com/live/best-meditation-apps-to-calm-down) are great for getting your mindfulness feet wet because they offer guided sessions and suggest ways to structure your routine.**

### **Call up your closest friend**

**If your first reaction is to bury anxiety and try carrying on, reaching out to someone you trust completely might be the answer you need.**

**Anxiety can be extremely isolating, like a storm raging inside your body that no one else can see. But without an outlet, the storm just grows stronger and more volatile.**

**The act of putting your feelings into words can release some of that pressure. It doesn’t have to be some well-crafted soliloquy. It can be as simple as, “I feel bad right now and I’m having a hard time explaining why.”**

**You might be surprised to find how therapeutic it is to be vulnerable like this with another person.**

### **Listen to some tunes**

**You know that feeling when you turn on a song you love and something inside of you lights up? That pleasure response is actually hardwired in all of us.**

**Research has found listening to music [activates the same parts of our brain](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC58814/) as sex and drugs.**

**Because of this, listening to music may be a great way to find somewhat immediate relief from anxiety. One study with over 2,000 people showed listening to music before going into surgery significantly [lowered anxiety levels](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23740695).**

### **Just leave**

**For those who experience [social anxiety](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/social-anxiety-disorder-more-than-just-shyness/index.shtml), crowded spaces and circumstances with lots of socializing can be a battlefield of anxiety triggers.**

**Social anxiety often includes the acute fear that everyone is judging you or having to deal with the awkwardness of your mind going blank from nerves every time someone tries to talk to you.**

**Sometimes, it can be beneficial to try to work through this discomfort. But if you’re reacting strongly to a certain setting, there’s really no shame in leaving.**

**In fact, taking the initiative to remove yourself from an uncomfortable situation can be incredibly liberating.**

### **Try the “Facts vs. fiction” writing exercise**

**If you’re anxiety is spiking, try grabbing a pen and paper and simply writing down the facts of what’s happening. Make sure you stick to the facts. “I’m behind on my deadline at new job.”**

**Then write how you feel about the facts and what you fear will happen. For example, “I’m worried that if I don’t get everything done on time my manager will think I’m not worthy of this job and may decide to replace me.”**

**As you write your feelings, reflect on how many steps it will take to get from fact to fear. Sometimes doing this can help reveal how to alleviate uncontrollable fears and help you focus on what can be done in the moment.**

## **How to calm down in under an hour**

**If you have more time to spare, use these techniques to settle your body and mind.**

### **Move your body**

**The brain loves exercise. Running has been shown to help the hippocampus [manage anxiety](https://www.jneurosci.org/content/33/18/7770), while exercise in general [increases the availability of feel-good brain chemicals](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/can-exercise-help-treat-anxiety-2019102418096) like serotonin.**

**Not to mention, it helps relieve the muscular tension brought on by anxiety.**

#### **All the ways to do it**

**Where do we even start? There are SO many ways to exercise. First off, find something you don’t hate doing. If you absolutely abhor running, then it’s going to be pretty hard to make yourself do it.**

**Exercise doesn’t have to mean training for a triathlon. There are tons of fun, low-key activities that can get your body moving. Here are some of our faves:**

- **Dancing. Yes, dancing alone in your room counts! Or, try going out to a salsa club or maybe it’s finally time to take that [pole dancing class](https://greatist.com/grow/pole-dancing-and-wellness).**
- **Hiking. Not only is this exercise, research suggests being in in nature can [improve your mood](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4204431/). If you aren’t familiar with hiking trails in your area, check out the [Alltrails hiking app](https://www.alltrails.com/).**
- **Yoga/stretching. You don’t need to pay a bunch of money at a fancy studio to get the [mental and physical benefits](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3193654/) of yoga. Try this beginning-friendly [morning yoga routine](https://greatist.com/move/morning-yoga-for-beginners).**
- **YouTube workout. There are a bazillion totally free workout videos online for every level of difficulty. Here’s [a roundup](https://greatist.com/move/best-free-workout-videos-youtube) of our 20 favorites.**

### **Journal it out**

**[Journaling](https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content.aspx?ContentID=4552&ContentTypeID=1) is about taking that blizzard of negativity swirling inside your body and putting it into words in order to understand _why_ you’re feeling the way you are.**

**It’s also a great way to remind yourself of the difference between the facts/reality and what you perceive through your anxiety.**

**“By writing down fears and worries in a journal, it removes them from the mind, “says Sherman. “Journaling can be a way to get things off your mind and to examine what was written and examine it when feeling calmer.”**

**Research suggests journaling could be a longer term strategy for dealing with stress as well. In one study, journaling was shown to effectively help participants [cope with the stress](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4612649/) of an upcoming presentation.**

#### **How to do it**

1. **Make it a habit. This doesn’t have to be every day but the more regularly you write down how you’re feeling, the better you’ll be at articulating yourself.**
2. **Reserve judgement. No one ever has to read this journal! Don’t get hung up trying to craft a piece of literature. This is for you and only you.**
3. **Splurge on a nice pen and journal. Trust us, these things help!**

### **Soak in a bath or take a shower**

**If you’re stressed, a warm bath or shower not only loosens tense muscles, it’s a nice way to get [some peace and quiet](https://greatist.com/grow/baths-as-recovery). Plus, sometimes the physical act of getting clean has a way of purifying the mind.**

**And if you’re having trouble sleeping, you may want to take a bath before getting in bed. A 10 to 15 minute soak has been shown to help people fall asleep [10 minutes faster](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1087079218301552?via%3Dihub#abs0010).**

### **Other ways to cope**

- **Clean your room/house. Having a cluttered living space is associated [with more life dissatisfaction](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/03/well/mind/clutter-stress-procrastination-psychology.html). You don’t have to KonMari the place — stacking things so you can sit on the floor also works.**
- **Put on a funny show. The act of smiling may actually help you _[feel happier](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25139308)_. We like the episodic kind, like “Schitt’s Creek,” “Parks and Recreation,” and “Superstore.”**
- **Spend some money on yourself. One study showed retail therapy did help [raise people’s moods](https://northstarpsych.com/files_uploaded/8df9f1b646b4900b8dd33849f6e898c5.pdf). Buy that matcha latte!**
- **Draw. Adult coloring books are a relaxing way to occupy yourself if you’re feeling anxious. Make doodles like you’re in school again.**
