**Despite the somewhat exotic name, box breathing is a very simple and even familiar type of stress management exercise. If you've ever found yourself inhaling and exhaling to a rhythm while you run or listen to music, you've taken the first steps. Box breathing is a type of paced breathing that follows a certain rhythm, and it can help you to [minimize stress](https://www.verywellmind.com/tips-to-reduce-stress-3145195).**

## How Box Breathing Works

**Box breathing, also known as four-square breathing, involves exhaling to a count of four, holding your lungs empty for a four-count, inhaling at the same pace, and holding air in your lungs for a count of four before exhaling and beginning the pattern anew.**

## How Box Breathing Compares to Other Forms of Stress Management

**Box breathing doesn't carry the physical [benefits of exercise](https://www.verywellmind.com/best-types-of-stress-reduction-exercise-3144931) or the long-term mental and [resilience](https://www.verywellmind.com/ways-to-become-more-resilient-2795063) benefits of meditation, but it definitely has its place as a stress management technique. For one thing, it's very simple to learn and to practice.<sup> </sup>Also, it can be practiced virtually anywhere and anytime—when you're showering, watching tv, or even working.**

**You can give it a try anywhere when you're not so distracted that you can't spare any attention, or exercising so strenuously that you can't talk through it. Also, you can practice box breathing for only a minute or two and experience the immediate benefits of a calm body and a more relaxed mind, or you can practice for several minutes and experience that plus the longer-term benefits of meditation, including increased resilience to stress, decreased feelings of depression, increased positive feelings, and more.**

## What the Research Says

**Unfortunately, there's not a lot of research specifically on box breathing, as this is a relatively new technique. However, there is quite a bit of research on [breathing exercises](https://www.verywellmind.com/abdominal-breathing-2584115) in general, and on paced breathing as well, which is the category of breathing exercise this would best fit. There is also research on [visualization](https://www.verywellmind.com/visualization-for-relaxation-2584112) and meditation, of course, and the practice of box breathing can facilitate both of these. For visualization, simply imagine that you are inflating and draining a balloon with each cycle, for example. For meditation, you can add affirmation as you breathe.**

**Here are some study findings that may support the possible benefits of box breathing:**

1. **Studies on transcendental meditation and [mindfulness-based stress reduction](https://www.verywellmind.com/benefits-of-mindfulness-based-stress-reduction-88861)—another form of meditation—have found that meditation (mantra-based and mindfulness-based) can both lead to decreased stress and anxiety, lower blood pressure, greater feelings of happiness, and reduced feelings of depression.<sup>4</sup>﻿ While this isn't specific research on box breathing, box breathing may be helpful for getting into a meditative state.**
2. **Research on deep breathing shows that it is useful not only for stress management but also for reducing blood pressure and minimizing hypertension as well.**
3. **Studies have found that simple practices like breathing exercises are effective in reducing stress in everyday situations like the experience of test anxiety, sometimes to a greater degree than more complex stress management techniques.**

## How to Practice Box Breathing

**Box breathing is exceedingly simple to practice. Simply relax your body and do the following:**

- **Let out all of the air in your lungs to the count of four.**
- **Keep your lungs empty for a count of four.**
- **Inhale for a count of four.**
- **Keep your lungs full for a count of four.**

**That's it! You can vary this in a few different ways. As mentioned before, you can invite in the silent repetition of an affirmation by syncing it with your breath rather than counting to four. "Mississippi," or something with four syllables can work well—"I feel so calm," "I'm here right now," or even just "O-o-m-m," stretched out to four counts can work.**

**Another variation is to visualize four sides of a box changing to a new color, one after the other, or in a line as though the box is being traced by a colored pen you hold with your mind, making this into a visualization exercise. If you practice for longer—10 to 20 minutes, for example—it can fall under the umbrella of meditation practices. Research on the possible benefits of box breathing is still needed, but incorporating meditative practices into your life may have lasting benefits.**
